# Urban-Sound-classification
Classification of UrbanSound8K dataset using transfer learning

In this project, I'll show how I used a pre-trained model to classify audio samples to 10 different categories.

The main idea is to make a spectrogram from each WAV file and to address the problem as an image classification problem.

Based on Inception, a pre-trained CNN which was trained to classify Imagenet dataset to 1,000 of classes, I trained my model to  successfuly 
classify spectrograms into 10 different sound sources.
